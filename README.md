# 1Code

[1Code.dev](https://1code.dev)

Best UI for Claude Code with local and remote agent execution.

By [21st.dev](https://21st.dev) team

> **Platforms:** macOS, Linux, and Windows. Windows support improved thanks to community contributions from [@jesus-mgtc](https://github.com/jesus-mgtc) and [@evgyur](https://github.com/evgyur).

## Features

### Run Claude agents the right way

Run agents locally, in worktrees, in background — without touching main branch.

![Worktree Demo](assets/worktree.gif)

- **Git Worktree Isolation** - Each chat session runs in its own isolated worktree
- **Background Execution** - Run agents in background while you continue working
- **Local-first** - All code stays on your machine, no cloud sync required
- **Branch Safety** - Never accidentally commit to main branch

---

### UI that finally respects your code

Cursor-like UI for Claude Code with diff previews, built-in git client, and the ability to see changes before they land.

- **Diff Previews** - See exactly what changes Claude is making in real-time
- **Built-in Git Client** - Stage, commit, and manage branches without leaving the app
- **Change Tracking** - Visual diffs and PR management
- **Real-time Tool Execution** - See bash commands, file edits, and web searches as they happen

---

### Plan mode that actually helps you think

Claude asks clarifying questions, builds structured plans, and shows clean markdown preview — all before execution.

- **Clarifying Questions** - Claude asks what it needs to know before starting
- **Structured Plans** - See step-by-step breakdown of what will happen
- **Clean Markdown Preview** - Review plans in readable format
- **Review Before Execution** - Approve or modify the plan before Claude acts

### More Features

- **Plan & Agent Modes** - Read-only analysis or full code execution permissions
- **Project Management** - Link local folders with automatic Git remote detection
- **Integrated Terminal** - Full terminal access within the app

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Flox** - For reproducible development environment ([install instructions](https://flox.dev/docs))
- **Devyard environment** - 1code inherits TypeScript tooling from the devyard Flox environment (must be accessible via symlink at `./devyard`)
- **Python 3** - For native module compilation (inherited from devyard)
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (macOS) - Run `xcode-select --install`

### Option 1: Build from source (free)

```bash
# 1. Activate Flox environment (manages bun, electron, inherits from devyard)
cd /path/to/1code
flox activate

# 2. Install JavaScript dependencies
bun install

# 3. Download Claude binary (required for agent functionality)
bun run claude:download

# 4. Build and package
bun run build
bun run package:mac  # or package:win, package:linux
```

> **Important:** The Flox environment provides bun, electron, and inherits TypeScript LSP from devyard. The `claude:download` step downloads the Claude CLI binary which is required for agent chat functionality.
